  <h1>Understanding Poverty in India</h1>
  <p>Poverty in India is a complex issue shaped by a range of social, economic, and political factors. It includes income deprivation, lack of access to basic services, and socio-economic exclusion.</p>
  <p>Government welfare schemes such as food security programs, employment guarantees, and housing initiatives aim to alleviate these conditions. Understanding the root causes of poverty is essential in shaping more effective policies and interventions.</p>
  <p>Through education, empowerment, and inclusive development, India strives to uplift millions out of poverty.</p>
